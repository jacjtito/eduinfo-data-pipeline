# Data Samples Directory

This directory is for storing CSV sample files for analysis and mapping to database tables.

## Usage

1. Download CSV files from data sources
2. Save them here with descriptive names
3. Use Claude to analyze structure and match to database tables

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the source:
- `insee_bpe_2023_sample.csv`
- `education_gouv_lycees_sample.csv`
- `criminalite_commune_sample.csv`
- etc.

## Structure Analysis

For each CSV, we can:
- ✅ Identify column names and types
- ✅ Match to existing database tables
- ✅ Detect separator (comma vs semicolon)
- ✅ Check data quality
- ✅ Generate import scripts

## Note

This directory is for **samples only** - full downloads go to `../downloads/`
